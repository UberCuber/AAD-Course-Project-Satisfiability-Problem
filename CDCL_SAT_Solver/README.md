# CDCL-SAT
A SAT Solver based on CDCL (Conflict Driven Clause Learning) implemented in Python.

SAT is the satisfiability problem wherein we are given some clauses containing propositional variables and the correspoding literals and we need to find whether 
the formula is satisfiable or unsatisfiable. A SAT Solver is a program that solves a SAT problem. Most of the state-of-the-art SAT solvers nowadays use the 
CDCL (Conflict Driven Clause Learning) algorithm to implement the solver.


The contents of this folder and how to use them:

1. [Makefile] : To compile the program, do make
2. [solver.cpp file](solver.cpp): to run the solver from the terminal. Use:
```
./solver.cpp <to_log> <decider> <restarter> <inputfile>
```
in the terminal
where to_log must be True or False, decider must be ORDERED, MINISAT or VSIDS, restarter must be None, GEOMETRIC
or LUBY and inputfile should be a valid path to the input file which has the SAT problem in DIMACS CNF format.

For eg.

```
./solver.cpp False MINISAT None test/sat/bmc-2.cnf
```

3. [verifier.cpp file](verifier.cpp): Checks if the assignment generated by the solver is indeed a valid assignment. Use:
```
./verifier <inputfile> <assignmentfile>
```
in the terminal
where,
inputfile should be a valid path to the input file which has the SAT problem in DIMACS CNF format (eg. test/sat/bmc-1.cnf)
and assignmentfile should be valid path to the assignmentfile generated by the solver (eg. Result/assgn_bmc-1.cnf).
